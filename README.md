GreenLoop is a web application that encourages recycling by allowing users to log their recycling activities and track their environmental impact. Users earn points for their efforts, achieve badges based on their total points, and can view their progress through an interactive impact tracker chart. The platform also offers a recycling guide, a rewards system, activity history summaries, and profile customization options to enhance user engagement and promote sustainable habits.
